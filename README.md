Hi, I'm Andrei. Here are a list of facts about me:

- Born in Santos, São Paulo. The city of Pelé.
- Worked for Petrobras during 5 years. During this period, learned a lot
about the Oil and Gas industry.
- Studied abroad for 1 year in the beautiful city of Brighton (UK).
- Dropped a masters' degree on Recommender Systems after 2.5 years trying
to understand and foster serendipity in Recsys.
- Love other people's pets. Scared about the possibility to have one.
- Vegetarian since 2016.
- I enjoy doing things the right way!
- Very systematic person. Always trying to look at the bigger picture and
optimize for the long run instead of pursuing short term gains.
- Like to learn new programming languages and frameworks.
- Probably the next programming language I will give a try is C++ for fast matrix
operations.
- Struggling to make meaningful contributions to Open Source Software.
